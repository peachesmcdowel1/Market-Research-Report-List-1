<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-Based Primers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Odorless</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil-based primers are commonly classified into two main types based on their odor characteristics: odorless and others. Odorless oil-based primers are formulated to minimize the strong smell traditionally associated with oil-based paint products, making them ideal for indoor use in well-ventilated spaces. On the other hand, the "others" category includes oil-based primers with varying levels of odor intensity, suitable for outdoor projects or areas with proper ventilation. Both types offer effective sealing and adhesion properties, providing a smooth and durable surface for paint application.</p></p>
