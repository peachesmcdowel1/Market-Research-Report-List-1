<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Mount Delay Line Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive</li><li>Active</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface mount delay lines come in two different market types: passive and active. Passive delay lines consist of simple electrical components that introduce a predetermined delay in a signal passing through them. They are often used for simple timing and signal matching applications. On the other hand, active delay lines contain additional electronics that allow for more complex signal manipulation, such as amplification or filtering. This makes active delay lines suitable for more sophisticated signal processing tasks.</p></p>
