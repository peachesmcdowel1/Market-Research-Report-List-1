<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Monitoring Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Monitoring</li><li>Noninvasive Monitoring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial monitoring equipment market includes both invasive and noninvasive monitoring options. Invasive monitoring involves placing a device directly into the brain to monitor pressure, oxygen levels, and other critical parameters. This method provides highly accurate data but carries risks of infection and discomfort for the patient. On the other hand, noninvasive monitoring utilizes external sensors to gather information such as brain activity and blood flow without the need for invasive procedures. Noninvasive monitoring is less risky but may not provide as precise data as invasive methods.</p></p>
