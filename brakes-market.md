<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brake Pads</li><li>Brake Shoes</li><li>Brake Lining</li><li>Brake Rotor</li><li>Brake Drum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The brakes market consists of various types of brake components such as brake pads, brake shoes, brake lining, brake rotor, and brake drum. Brake pads are friction materials that press against the brake rotor to slow down or stop a vehicle. Brake shoes work in a similar way but press against the brake drum instead. Brake lining provides the friction needed for braking, while the brake rotor and drum are the components that the brake pads/shoes press against to create the necessary friction for stopping the vehicle.</p></p>
