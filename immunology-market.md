<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immunology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immuno Boosters</li><li>Immunosuppressants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The immunology market comprises two major types: immuno boosters and immunosuppressants. Immuno boosters are substances or products that enhance the immune system, protecting the body against infections and diseases. They include vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements. On the other hand, immunosuppressants are medications that intentionally weaken the immune system. These are used in cases where the immune system is overactive or attacking healthy cells and tissues, such as in autoimmune diseases or organ transplant recipients. Both immuno boosters and immunosuppressants play significant roles in managing immune-related conditions.</p></p>
