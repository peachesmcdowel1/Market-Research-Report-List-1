<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Assist Devices (CAD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular Assist Device</li><li>Total Artificial Heart</li><li>Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Assist Devices (CAD) are medical devices used to support and improve the function of the heart in patients with heart failure or other cardiovascular conditions. There are three main types of CAD devices: Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs), Total Artificial Hearts (TAHs), and Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps (IABPs). VADs help pump blood from the ventricles to the rest of the body, TAHs replace the entire heart temporarily, and IABPs increase blood flow to the heart by inflating and deflating a balloon in the aorta. These devices play a crucial role in managing heart-related conditions and improving patients' quality of life.</p></p>
