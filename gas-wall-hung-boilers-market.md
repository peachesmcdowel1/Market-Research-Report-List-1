<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Wall Hung Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas wall hung boilers are classified into two main types: condensing and non-condensing. Condensing boilers utilize a secondary heat exchanger to extract more heat from the flue gases, resulting in higher efficiency and lower energy costs. Non-condensing boilers, on the other hand, do not have this feature and therefore have lower efficiency. Condensing boilers are more environmentally friendly and compliant with energy efficiency standards, while non-condensing boilers are typically less expensive upfront but may cost more to operate in the long run.</p></p>
