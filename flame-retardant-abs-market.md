<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant ABS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-halogen Type</li><li>Halogen Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame retardant ABS market is divided into two main types: non-halogen type and halogen type. Non-halogen type flame retardants are considered more environmentally friendly as they do not contain halogenated compounds. They work by releasing free radicals that interrupt the combustion process. On the other hand, halogen type flame retardants contain halogen elements like chlorine or bromine, which can produce toxic gases when burned. Both types are used in various industries to improve the fire resistance of ABS materials.</p></p>
