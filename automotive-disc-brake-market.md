<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Disc Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Opposed Piston</li><li>Floating Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive disc brake systems can be categorized into two main types: opposed piston and floating caliper. Opposed piston systems feature multiple pistons on both sides of the brake rotor, applying even pressure for better braking performance. Floating caliper systems have a single piston on one side of the rotor, which moves within the caliper to apply pressure. While opposed piston designs offer higher performance, floating caliper systems are simpler and more cost-effective, making them more common in consumer vehicles.</p></p>
