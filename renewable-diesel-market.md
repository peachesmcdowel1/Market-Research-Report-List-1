<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renewable Diesel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>From Lipids</li><li>From Cellulosic Biomass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Renewable diesel from lipids is derived from fats and oils, such as vegetable oil, animal fats, and waste oils. This type of renewable diesel is more common and commercially available compared to renewable diesel from cellulosic biomass, which is produced from non-food sources like agricultural residues, wood chips, and grasses. While lipids-based renewable diesel has been in the market for a longer time and has a more established supply chain, renewable diesel from cellulosic biomass is considered more sustainable and environmentally friendly due to its non-food source feedstocks.</p></p>
