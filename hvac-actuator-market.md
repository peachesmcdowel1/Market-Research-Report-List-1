<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HVAC Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return HVAC Actuator</li><li>Non-Spring Return HVAC Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HVAC Actuators are devices used to control the flow of air in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. There are two main types in the market: Spring Return and Non-Spring Return. </p><p>Spring Return actuators use a spring to return the actuator to its default position when power is removed, providing fail-safe operation. On the other hand, Non-Spring Return actuators do not use a spring for return, offering more precise control over airflow. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring efficient and reliable operation of HVAC systems.</p></p>
