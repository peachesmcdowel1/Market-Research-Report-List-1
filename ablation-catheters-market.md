<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ablation Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multielectrode Ablation Catheters</li><li>Single Point Ablation Catheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ablation catheters are medical devices used to treat various heart rhythm disorders. Multielectrode ablation catheters have multiple small electrode tips, allowing for simultaneous ablation of multiple areas of the heart. They can provide more effective and efficient treatment compared to single point ablation catheters, which have only one electrode tip. Multielectrode catheters are typically used in complex cases, while single point catheters are suitable for simpler cases. Both types of catheters play crucial roles in the ablation catheters market by providing different options for physicians to treat different patients.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Ablation Catheters Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Supraventricular Tachycardia</li><li>Atrial Fibrillation</li><li>Ventricular Tachycardia</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ablation catheters are used for minimally invasive treatment procedures to correct abnormal heart rhythms. In the field of cardiology, they are commonly used for treating Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT), Atrial Fibrillation (AF), and Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). SVT is a rapid heart rate originating from above the ventricles, while AF is an irregular and fast heart rhythm. VT, on the other hand, is a rapid heartbeat that begins in the ventricles. Ablation catheters deliver energy to specific areas of the heart, destroying the abnormal tissue responsible for these conditions.</p></p>
