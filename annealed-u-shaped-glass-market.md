<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Annealed U-Shaped Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transparent</li><li>Translucent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Annealed U-shaped glass can be classified into two main categories based on its level of clarity: transparent and translucent. Transparent U-shaped glass allows light to pass through clearly, providing a clear view of objects on the other side. On the other hand, translucent U-shaped glass allows some light to pass through but diffuses it, making objects on the other side appear blurry or not fully visible. Both types of glass have their own unique applications and are selected based on the desired level of privacy and aesthetics.</p></p>
