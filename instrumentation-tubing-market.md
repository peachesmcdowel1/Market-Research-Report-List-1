<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instrumentation Tubing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Seamless Tubing</li><li>Welded Tubing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Instrumentation tubing market can be classified into two main types: seamless tubing and welded tubing. Seamless tubing is manufactured by piercing a solid billet of metal and extruding it into a hollow tube without any seams. This results in a smooth interior surface which is ideal for applications requiring high pressure and corrosion resistance. On the other hand, welded tubing is made by rolling a flat strip of metal into a tube shape and welding the seam. Although it is more cost-effective, welded tubing may have a rougher interior surface compared to seamless tubing.</p></p>
