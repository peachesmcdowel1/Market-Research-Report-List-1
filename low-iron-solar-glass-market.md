<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Iron Solar Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Glass</li><li>Float Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low iron solar glass is categorized into two main types: rolled glass and float glass. Rolled glass is manufactured by pouring molten glass onto a metal table and then rolling it into sheets of the desired thickness. Float glass, on the other hand, is produced by floating molten glass on a bed of molten tin, resulting in a higher quality and more uniform sheet. Both types of glass are used in the solar industry due to their high transparency and low iron content, which allows for maximum sunlight absorption.</p></p>
