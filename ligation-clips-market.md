<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ligation Clips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Titanium</li><li>Polymer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ligation clips are medical devices used to close blood vessels during surgical procedures. The two main types of ligation clips are titanium and polymer. Titanium clips are made of a biocompatible metal that provides good security and long-term stability. Polymer clips, on the other hand, are made of a non-metallic material that is flexible and less prone to tissue trauma. Both types of clips offer reliable vessel closure, but the choice between them depends on the surgeon's preference and the specific surgical requirements.</p></p>
