<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prostate Cancer Nuclear Medicine Diagnostics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SPECT</li><li>PET</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Prostate cancer nuclear medicine diagnostics encompass two main types of imaging techniques: SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) and PET (positron emission tomography). SPECT uses radioactive tracers to create detailed images of the prostate gland, allowing for the detection and monitoring of cancerous cells. PET imaging involves injecting a radioactive sugar solution that is taken up by cancer cells, providing a more accurate and detailed view of tumor activity. Both SPECT and PET play vital roles in diagnosing and managing prostate cancer effectively.</p></p>
