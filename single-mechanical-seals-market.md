<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pusher Type Seal</li><li>Non-pusher Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single mechanical seals are used in various industries for preventing leakage of fluids in pumps and mixers. Pusher type seals have a dynamic secondary seal that moves axially along the shaft to maintain contact with the primary seal face. Non-pusher seals, on the other hand, do not require any axial movement of the secondary seal. Pusher type seals are usually preferred for applications with high speeds and pressures, while non-pusher seals are more commonly used in moderate operating conditions.</p></p>
