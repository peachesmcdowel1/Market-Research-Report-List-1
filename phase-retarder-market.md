<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phase Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Copper Phase Retarders</li><li>Prism Phase Retarders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phase retarders are optical devices that alter the phase difference between two perpendicular polarizations of light. Copper phase retarders are made of a thin layer of copper deposited on a glass substrate, allowing for precise control of phase delay. Prism phase retarders, on the other hand, use the principle of total internal reflection to achieve phase retardation. Both types of phase retarders are used in various applications such as polarization microscopy, interferometry, and telecommunications to manipulate and control the polarization of light.</p></p>
